# Project Jammming

Project Jammming is built to exemplify react capabilty

This application depend on Spotify Api(s) for data fetching   

It also allow a user to authorise and add a customised playlists   
to their user's account on spotify   

Although this application was built from scratch while using Rsbuild, it would be better 
to use a framework prefferably Next.js (for me) if the application needs to scale.   

In that case, architecture, routing and coordination will be seemless amongs developers 
within a team.
